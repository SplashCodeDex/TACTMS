###  **Basic Idea/Logic of this project.**



There is a church called The Apostolic Church in Ghana. This church is structured into levels; National, Area, District and Local/Assembly. Where Locals/Assemblies is the actual church(example; Ayiresu, Central, Maranatha) where people worship, District is the administration that covers particular set of locals. Example; Jei-Krodua(Jei-Krodua is my district but there are other districts such as Silom, K2, Ofaankor and many more). Area is the administration that covers particular set of Districts such as Jei-Krodua and  Ofaankor. Lastly,  National are the executives in charge of the church across Ghana, the head, and the administrations that covers the all the Area. Also, information and rules is passed down in the order that i have said(National - Area - District -Assembly/Local). Also, the church has an online website system called TACMS(The Apostolic Church Management System) that administrators can use to manage members, souls, transactions, projects, and many more scoped to the level they are in. TACMS recognize every member by their membership ID. The  most important thing is that every member has an ID (PASTOR JONATHAN ADDO MENSAH (TAC89JAM131001|651101008)). Not even a single member will be without a membership Id. names can be the same or similar but not the ID because the ID is unique to every member and it is assigned by the TACMS immediately after registering the member use to identify every member.  Now. I, CodeDeX happen to be in Jei-Krodua District. I am now the District Administrator at District level. I have decided to create this project called TACTMS (The Apostolic Church Tithe Made Simple) to manage the tithe transactions and souls for now. Since TACMS has no API logic, I rely on the excel files that i am able to download then make my project, TACTMS uses that excel file. Currently, i can only download two excel files. Lets call them A(Markdown version :L W:\\CodeDeX\\TACTMS\\AboutThisAPP\\A.md) and B(Markdown version: W:\\CodeDeX\\TACTMS\\AboutThisAPP\\B.md). The A, excel file which is raw data and includes marital status, type of marriage, age, Gender and many more for the members. this  raw excel file is actually the membership details. The B excel file  has payment method, transaction amount, narration/description, and so on. Note: the B excel structure is the only excel file TACMS acknowledges and receives to process the alerts therefore  it is the exact excel structure TACTMS(our project) needs to produce in our final export (Download Excel) which means TACTMS must see to it that only after the  Transaction Amount(since the rest are all the same except the "Transaction Date ('DD-MMM-YYYY)" which will use the selected Sunday date and the "Narration/Description" which will be populated with "Tithe for 'the  selected date' like: Tithe for 02-NOV-2025) that it can final export(Download excel). Also in the A.md or A.pdf, there  is "membership number(TAC89JAM131001)", " old membership number(651101008)" , "Title(PASTOR)", "First Name(JONATHAN)", "Surname(ADDO)", "other name(MENSAH)" but notice how  for the B.md or B.pdf, we have "Membership Number(PASTOR JONATHAN ADDO MENSAH (TAC89JAM131001|651101008))" which is simply achieved by concatenating "membership number(TAC89JAM131001)", " old membership number(651101008)" , "Title(PASTOR)", "First Name(JONATHAN)", "Surname(ADDO)", "other name(MENSAH)" from the A with only the Membership  and the old membership number  separated by "|".  Note: the least compulsory format for the Membership Number field passing in the B structuring are First Name, Surname,  the membership number(TAC89JAM131001) because all members posses this data and an example is JONATHAN ADDO (TAC89JAM131001).
