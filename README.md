TACTMS is a modern, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) built to revolutionize how local assemblies of The Apostolic Church manage their tithe records and membership data. It provides a seamless, native-like experience on both desktop and mobile devices, complete with offline capabilities.

At its core, TACTMS leverages AI-powered analysis to provide deep insights into uploaded data, all through an intuitive and interactive chat interface. It's more than a data processor; it's a tool for understanding and growth.

## Key Features

- **üìÇ Effortless Data Import**: Upload standard Excel files and let the app intelligently process and reconcile the data.
- **üîÑ Membership Reconciliation**: Automatically compare uploaded tithe lists against a master member database, flagging discrepancies and new members.
- **üìä Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize trends, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and get an at-a-glance overview of your assembly's financial health.
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Secure Cloud Sync**: Keep your data safe and accessible across all your devices with seamless Google Drive integration.
- **üîå Offline First**: Works without an internet connection. All data is stored locally and synced to the cloud when you're back online.
- **üíª Installable App**: Install TACTMS directly to your desktop or mobile home screen for a fast, native-app experience.
