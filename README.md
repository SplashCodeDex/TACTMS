### Cloud Sync Configuration (For Developers)

To enable the Google Drive Cloud Sync feature during development, you need to provide your own Google API credentials.

1.  **Create a `.env.local` file** in the root of the project.
2.  **Add the following environment variables** to the file:

    ```
    VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
    ```

3.  **Replace the placeholder values** with your actual Google API Key and Client ID. You can obtain these from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

> **Note:** This step is only necessary for developers running the application locally. The production build will have these values pre-configured.
